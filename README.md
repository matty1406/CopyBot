# Discord.js Copy Bot:

A Discord bot that will copy any deleted message by a user of your choice. Made as a joke bot.

# Installation:

The modules come with the repository but in case they do not work, use `npm install discord.js` to install the bot.

You must then make a bot within [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the following permissions:

  **For legal reasons, DO NOT use this bot on unconsenting users.**
